  "summary": "The diff does not contain any deployment-related changes. The BuildRequest asks to retry a failed deployment process (REQ-1), but the actual changes are limited to code modifications in backend/main.mo (user profile and approval system logic) and metadata updates in project_state.json. No deployment scripts, configuration files, CI/CD workflows, or deployment commands are present in the diff.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Retry the deployment process that failed in the previous attempt",
      "reason": "No deployment-related changes are present in the diff. The acceptance criteria require re-initiating deployment, logging deployment errors, and ensuring application accessibility after deployment. The diff only shows application code changes (user profiles/approval logic) and metadata updates, with no deployment scripts, infrastructure configuration, CI/CD pipeline updates, or deployment commands.",
